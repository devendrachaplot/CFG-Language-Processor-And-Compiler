    This is a language processor that 

    - takes as input GCC tree-cfg (control flow graph) dumps and 
    - either interprets them or compiles them into spim assembly based 
      on a command line parameters. 

    The complete functionality supported by cfglp is best described by the usage printed by it:


    Usage: cfglp [options] [file]
     Options:
          -help     Show this help
          -tokens   Show the tokens in file.toks (or out.toks)
          -ast      Show abstract syntax trees in file.ast (or out.ast)
          -symtab   Show the symbol table of declarations in file.sym (or out.sym)
          -program  Show the complete program read by cfglp in file.prog (or out.prog)
                    (-program option cannot be given with -tokens, -ast, or -symtab) 
          -eval     Interpret the program and show a trace of the execution in file.eval (or out.eval)
          -compile  Compile the program and generate spim code in file.spim (or out.spim)
                    (-eval and -compile options are mutually exclusive)
                    (-compile is the default option)
          -lra      Do local register allocation to avoid redundant loads within a basic block
          -icode    Compile the program and show the intermediate code in file.ic (or out.ic)
                    (-eval and -icode options are mutually exclusive)
          -d        Demo version. Use stdout for the outputs instead of files


    At the moment cfglp accepts level 0 language that defines simple cfgs corresponding to 
    programs that contain 

    - only integer variables and numbers, 
    - only assignment statements, no control flow, no function calls
    - the right hand sides of the assignments can only be a scalar variable or a number
    - the main function does not return any value.

    Please see the files p1, p2, p3, and p4 for the examples of valid and invalid inputs.

    The subsequent versions would enhance the input language incrementally as follows:

    - Level 1: Allow floating point numbers and common arithmetic operations on the right hand
               side. The expectation is that the temporary variables introduced by GCC are
               eliminated and larger ASTs are created for right hand sides.
    - Level 2: Allow control flow statements and evaluation of conditions.
    - Level 3: Allow function calls (including recursion).
    - Level 3: Allow data and procedure encapsulation supported by classes.

   The cfglp embodies object oriented design and implementation. The implementation language is
   C++. The main classes that constitute cfglp are:

   - program, procedure, basic block, abstract syntax trees
   - symbol table (persistent as well as volatile symbol table for scope analysis
   - register and instruction descriptor
   - intermediate code
  
   The methods of these classes have been divided into file names with a suffix that represent
   the overall functionality eg. for ASTs, the classes are defined in ast.hh where as the methods
   are implemented in the files ast-build.cc, ast-print.cc, ast-typecheck.cc, ast-evaluate.cc,
   and ast-compile.cc.

   This implementation has the following dependencies:

   - It requires bison 2.7 (earlier versions do not support named attributes).
   - It requires flex 2.5 or higher.
   - It requires a contemporary g++ compiler.
   
  The dependencies for input and output are:
  - It accepts cfg dumps produced by GCC-4.4.3 or later. GCC by default does not dump global
    declarations so we need a dynamic plugin (provided separately) for program that contain 
    global variables.
  - The compiled assembly program can be executed on the spim simulator of MIPs.
